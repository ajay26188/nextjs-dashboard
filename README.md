## Financial Dashboard - Next.js App Router

This project is a **financial dashboard** built with Next.js, developed as part of my learning journey with the **Next.js App Router**.  
It follows the free interactive course available at [nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app).  

The goal of this project is to explore and practice Next.js features such as the App Router, layouts, nested routes, and server-side rendering while building a real-world style dashboard.
